# This works as follow:
# 1- Invoke  marker in non-interactive mode, this Ã®s to make sure that if only one result matches the user input
# - If only one result is matched, Replace the user input in the current shell prompt with it, without displaying marker interface or creating a new shell prompt
# - if more than one results are returned, then re-invoke the command with interactive mode
# 2- The result of Marker will be stored in a temporary file that will be read by the shell, and the user input will be replaced with the content of that file

    # Assume the shell use readline

    # A readline command is a literal sequence of characters and Meta-characters
